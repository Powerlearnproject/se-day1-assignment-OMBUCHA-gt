Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles or methods to develop and enhance high-quality software systems. Software enginnering is essential in technology industry as it enables in creation of software systems and applications that powers several aspects of life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The three milestones include development of programming language, establishment of software engineering as a displine in 1960s, and the emergence of structured programming in 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of sofware Development Life Cycle are:
Requirements:- It entails gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design:- Creating high level and detailed designs for users
Implementation:- Writing code and building softwares according to the specifications
Testing:- Contacting several tests to ensure the developed software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: Releasing the softwareproduct to the users
Maintenance: Regular maintence of the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is sequential approach with distinct phases, appropriate in downloading flows whiles agile is incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and response to changes. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer write codes and implement software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the quality of software
Projector Manager overseer the planning, excecuation and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is a software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes and examples include Visual studios
VCS is a software tool for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating works among team members and examples include Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges include tight deadline, change in requirement, and technical debt.Strategies to overcome include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritize tasks, and reqular assessment of the project goal. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing an individual unit or components of the sofware to ensure it is working as expected. It is important as it helps in early detection of debugs
Intergration testing checks how difference or modules of a software works together. It is essential in verifying interactions and detecting complex errors
System testing evaluates the whole software systems to ensure they are working together as expected. It is essential in verification of the system
Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing where verification is done to ensure the end product meets the business requirement and is ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Propt engineering is crafting statement to get the best possible response from the AI. Prompt enginnering helps in improving results, saving time, and preventing anbiguities

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Explain the importance of education, the improved part will read Explain the importance of primary education to astudent. The importance of improved prompt is to help get a more focused response.
